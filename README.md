# AWS Serverless 2FA Token Service
This repository showcases my POC for a serverless backend system to generate and deliver single-use tokens for two-factor authentication (2FA) on AWS. Key features include secure token generation, flexible delivery methods, resilience, and modular design. Documentation includes architecture, implementation steps, and security best practices.
